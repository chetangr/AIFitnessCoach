# AI Fitness Coach - Limitations & Constraints

## Overview

This document outlines the technical, operational, and business limitations that developers should be aware of when building and scaling the AI Fitness Coach application. Understanding these constraints is crucial for setting realistic expectations and planning appropriate mitigation strategies.

## 1. LLM API Limitations

### 1.1 Rate Limits

#### OpenAI GPT-4o
- **Requests per minute**: 500 (Tier 3) to 10,000 (Tier 5)
- **Tokens per minute**: 30,000 to 300,000
- **Daily request cap**: 10,000 to 100,000
- **Impact**: During peak hours, users may experience delayed AI responses

#### Claude 3.5 Sonnet
- **Requests per minute**: 50 (base) to 1,000 (enterprise)
- **Tokens per minute**: 20,000 to 100,000
- **Concurrent requests**: 50 to 500
- **Impact**: May need request queuing during high-traffic periods

#### Llama 3.3 70B (via Together AI)
- **Requests per second**: 20 (free tier) to 100 (paid)
- **Monthly token limit**: 10M (free) to unlimited (paid)
- **Timeout**: 30 seconds per request
- **Impact**: Free tier unsuitable for production use

### 1.2 Cost Constraints

```javascript
// Estimated costs per 1000 users/day
const llmCosts = {
  'gpt-4o': {
    inputCost: 0.005,  // per 1K tokens
    outputCost: 0.015, // per 1K tokens
    avgDailyCost: 150  // USD for 1000 active users
  },
  'claude-3.5-sonnet': {
    inputCost: 0.003,
    outputCost: 0.015,
    avgDailyCost: 120
  },
  'llama-3.3-70b': {
    inputCost: 0.0009,
    outputCost: 0.0009,
    avgDailyCost: 30
  }
};
```

### 1.3 Response Time Variability

- **Peak hours**: 2-5x slower response times
- **Model cold starts**: 5-10 second initial delay
- **Network latency**: 50-500ms additional overhead
- **Mitigation**: Implement response streaming and loading states

### 1.4 Context Window Limitations

| Model | Context Window | Effective Limit | Impact |
|-------|----------------|-----------------|--------|
| GPT-4o | 128K tokens | 100K practical | Long conversations may lose context |
| Claude 3.5 | 200K tokens | 150K practical | Better for extended coaching sessions |
| Llama 3.3 | 128K tokens | 100K practical | Similar to GPT-4o limitations |

### 1.5 Content Filtering

- **Prohibited content**: Medical advice, extreme diets, dangerous exercises
- **False positives**: 2-5% legitimate fitness advice blocked
- **Workaround**: Custom safety layer with override capability

## 2. Mobile Platform Constraints

### 2.1 iOS-Specific Limitations

#### App Store Restrictions
- **Review time**: 24-48 hours (can delay critical updates)
- **Health data**: HealthKit integration requires additional review
- **In-app purchases**: 30% commission on subscriptions
- **Background tasks**: Limited to 30 seconds without special entitlements

#### Technical Constraints
```swift
// iOS Background Task Limitations
struct iOSConstraints {
    static let backgroundExecutionTime = 30 // seconds
    static let backgroundRefreshMinInterval = 900 // 15 minutes
    static let memoryLimit = 200 // MB for extensions
    static let downloadSizeWiFiRequired = 200 // MB
}
```

### 2.2 Android-Specific Limitations

#### Platform Fragmentation
- **OS versions**: Must support Android 7.0+ (30% of devices on older versions)
- **Screen sizes**: 300+ different screen configurations
- **Performance**: Wide range from low-end to flagship devices

#### Technical Constraints
```kotlin
// Android Background Limitations
object AndroidConstraints {
    const val DOZE_MODE_DELAY = 15 * 60 * 1000L // 15 minutes
    const val FOREGROUND_SERVICE_REQUIRED = true // for long workouts
    const val BATTERY_OPTIMIZATION_EXEMPTION = "required_user_action"
    const val MAX_INTENT_SIZE = 1 * 1024 * 1024 // 1MB
}
```

### 2.3 Cross-Platform Development Trade-offs

#### Flutter Limitations
- **Native module integration**: Complex for platform-specific features
- **App size**: +20MB compared to native apps
- **Platform updates**: 2-4 week delay for new OS features

## Conclusion

These limitations are not roadblocks but guideposts for making informed technical decisions. By acknowledging and planning for these constraints upfront, developers can build a more robust and scalable AI Fitness Coach application. Regular review and updates of these limitations will be necessary as the technology landscape and regulatory environment evolve.
