- ✅ Zustand state management for auth, workouts, and theme
- ✅ React Navigation with auth flow and tab navigation
- ✅ Beautiful glassmorphism UI components
- ✅ Dark/light theme support
- ✅ Drag & drop workout scheduling with react-native-draggable-flatlist
- ✅ AI Coach chat interface with real-time messaging
- ✅ Complete authentication flow (login, register, demo mode)
- ✅ All main screens implemented (Compass, Workouts, Discover, Messages, Profile)

### 2. **Python FastAPI Backend**
- ✅ RESTful API with automatic documentation (Swagger/ReDoc)
- ✅ JWT-based authentication with secure password hashing
- ✅ PostgreSQL database with SQLAlchemy ORM
- ✅ OpenAI integration for AI coaching
- ✅ Complete API endpoints for:
  - Authentication (login, register, refresh, logout)
  - User management (profile, preferences, stats)
  - Workout management (CRUD, scheduling, versioning)
  - AI Coach chat (personalities, conversations, motivation)
  - Exercise library (search, filters, categories)
- ✅ Proper error handling and validation
- ✅ Environment-based configuration

### 3. **Key Features Preserved**
- ✅ Three AI coach personalities (Emma, Max, Dr. Progress)
- ✅ Workout plan versioning (undo/redo capability)
- ✅ Exercise library with 10,000+ exercises
- ✅ Progress tracking and statistics
- ✅ Schedule awareness for AI coach
- ✅ Demo account for quick testing
- ✅ Onboarding flow with coach selection

### 4. **UI/UX Enhancements**

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Backend
```bash
cd backend
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your configuration
python app.py
```

### Frontend
```bash
cd AIFitnessCoach
npm install
cp .env.example .env
npm run ios  # or npm run android
```

## 🔑 Key Technical Decisions

1. **Zustand over Redux**: Simpler state management with less boilerplate
2. **FastAPI over Django**: Modern, fast, with automatic API documentation
3. **PostgreSQL**: Robust relational database for complex data relationships
4. **TypeScript**: Full type safety across the React Native app
5. **Glassmorphism**: Modern, visually appealing UI design
6. **JWT Authentication**: Stateless, scalable authentication

## 🎯 Demo Access
