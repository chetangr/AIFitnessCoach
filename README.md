## Major Advantages

### Built-in Tracing and Debugging
The OpenAI Agents SDK provides comprehensive tracing that lets you visualize and debug your agentic flows, evaluate them, and even fine-tune models for your application. This solves debugging and monitoring needs out of the box.

### Addressing Zing's Core Problems
OpenAI's Agents SDK consolidates a previously fragmented complex ecosystem into a unified, production-ready framework. What previously required multiple frameworks, specialized vector databases, and complex orchestration logic can now be achieved through a single, standardized platform.

### Enterprise-Grade Reliability
The SDK focuses on reliability - a critical issue with most AI agents. The built-in guardrails, structured outputs, and automatic fallbacks ensure consistent, safe recommendations every time.

### Simplified Architecture
**Before (Traditional Approach)**:
- LangChain for orchestration
- Pinecone for vector search
- Custom state management
- Manual prompt engineering
- Complex error handling

**After (With Agents SDK + MCP)**:
- Single SDK handles agent orchestration
- MCP provides external data access
- Built-in conversation memory
- Automatic context handling
- Production-ready from day one
