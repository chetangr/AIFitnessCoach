  label, 
  icon, 
  size = 'large' 
}) => {
  const [pressed, setPressed] = useState(false);
  
  return (
    <TouchableOpacity
      onPressIn={() => {
        setPressed(true);
        Haptics.impactAsync(Haptics.Light);
      }}
      onPressOut={() => setPressed(false)}
      onPress={onPress}
      style={[
        styles.button,
        pressed && styles.buttonPressed,
        styles[`button${size}`]
      ]}
      activeOpacity={0.8}
    >
      {icon && <Icon name={icon} size={32} />}
      <Text style={styles.buttonText}>{label}</Text>
    </TouchableOpacity>
  );
};

const styles = {
  button: {
    minHeight: 64,
    minWidth: 200,
    borderRadius: 32,
    flexDirection: 'row',
    alignItems: 'center',
    justifyContent: 'center',
    gap: 12,
    paddingHorizontal: 24,
  },
  buttonPressed: {
    transform: [{ scale: 0.95 }],
  },
  buttonlarge: {
    minHeight: 80,
    fontSize: 20,
  },
  buttonText: {
    fontSize: 18,
    fontWeight: '600',
  }
};
```

## 🎉 Remember

**Every interaction should**:
1. Feel friendly and encouraging
2. Be forgiving of mistakes
3. Celebrate small wins
4. Never make users feel stupid
5. Always provide a way out

**The app should feel like**:
- A friendly coach, not a drill sergeant
- A helpful friend, not a complex tool
- A fun activity, not a chore
