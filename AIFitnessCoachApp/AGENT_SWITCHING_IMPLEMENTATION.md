# Agent Switching Implementation

## Summary

Fixed the agent switching functionality in the AI Coach chat interface. Now users can:
1. Select specific agents to respond to their messages
2. Switch between agents using the swap icon in the header
3. See which agents are currently selected
4. Ask specific agents for alternate perspectives on previous responses

## Changes Made

### Frontend Changes

1. **SimpleMessagesScreen.tsx**
   - Added `selectedAgentsForChat` state to track which agents are selected for general chat
   - Added agent selector button (swap-horiz icon) in the header
   - Updated `sendMessage` to pass selected agents to the backend
   - Modified `handleSelectAgent` to support both:
     - Selecting agents for future messages (from header button)
     - Asking specific agents about existing messages (from message long-press menu)
   - Added visual feedback showing selected agents with checkmarks
   - Updated header to show count of selected agents
   - Added "Clear Selection" button in agent selection modal

2. **backendAgentService.ts**
   - Already had support for `required_agents` parameter in `sendMultiAgentMessage`
   - Uses the authenticated `/api/multi-agent/chat` endpoint when logged in

### Backend Changes

1. **multi_agent.py**
   - Updated demo endpoint to support `required_agents` parameter
   - Added logic to convert agent strings to AgentType enums
   - Both demo and authenticated endpoints now properly route to specific agents

### UI Features

- **Agent Selector Modal**: Shows all available agents with selection checkmarks
- **Visual Feedback**: Selected agents are highlighted with purple border and checkmark
- **Header Indicator**: Shows "AI Coach (X agents)" when specific agents are selected
- **Toggle Functionality**: Clicking an agent toggles its selection on/off
- **Clear Selection**: Button to deselect all agents at once

## Available Agents

1. **Fitness Coach** (üí™) - General fitness guidance and workout planning
2. **Nutrition Specialist** (ü•ó) - Diet and nutrition advice
3. **Recovery & Wellness** (üßò) - Recovery strategies and wellness tips
4. **Goal Achievement** (üéØ) - Goal setting and progress tracking
5. **Form & Safety** (üõ°Ô∏è) - Exercise form and injury prevention
6. **Fitness Action** (üèÉ) - Workout execution and modifications

## Testing

Created `test-agent-switching.js` to verify the functionality:
```bash
node test-agent-switching.js
```

This tests:
- Single agent selection
- Multiple agent selection
- Auto-selection (when no specific agents are chosen)

## Usage

1. **Select agents for all messages**: Click the swap icon in the header, select agents, then send messages
2. **Ask specific agent about a response**: Long-press an AI message, select "Ask other agent", choose the agent
3. **Toggle multi-agent mode**: Use the people/person icon to switch between single and multi-agent modes
4. **Clear selection**: Use "Clear Selection" button or manually deselect all agents

## Next Steps

- Consider adding agent-specific colors or themes
- Add persistence for selected agents across sessions
- Show agent specialties in the selection modal
- Add quick selection presets (e.g., "Workout Help", "Nutrition Focus", etc.)
