  const parallaxStyle = useAnimatedStyle(() => ({
    transform: [
      { translateY: translateY.value * (index * 0.1) },
      { scale: 1 + (translateY.value * 0.0001) }
    ]
  }));
  
  return (
    <Animated.View style={[styles.card, parallaxStyle]}>
      <GlassCard intensity={25 + (index * 5)}>
        {/* Workout content */}
      </GlassCard>
    </Animated.View>
  );
};
```

### Phase 2: Floating Elements (Week 3-4)
```javascript
// Example: Floating AI coach responses
const FloatingMessage = ({ message, position }) => {
  return (
    <Animated.View style={[styles.floatingMessage, {
      transform: [
        { translateX: position.x },
        { translateY: position.y },
        { scale: 0.95 }
      ]
    }]}>
      <BlurView intensity={40} tint="light">

      </BlurView>
    </Animated.View>
  );
};
```

### Phase 3: Immersive Environments (Week 5-6)
```javascript
// Example: Workout environment overlay

    gym: require('../assets/environments/gym_overlay.png'),
    outdoor: require('../assets/environments/park_overlay.png'),
    home: require('../assets/environments/home_overlay.png')
  };
  
  return (
    <View style={StyleSheet.absoluteFillObject}>
      <Image source={environments[type]} style={styles.environmentOverlay} />
      <LinearGradient 
        colors={['transparent', 'rgba(0,0,0,0.3)']}
        style={StyleSheet.absoluteFillObject}
      />
    </View>
