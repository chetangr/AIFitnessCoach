# AI Coach Functional Actions System

## Overview
The AI Coach should be both informational AND functional - capable of performing real actions on the user's workout data, schedule, and fitness plans based on natural language requests. This document outlines all functional scenarios, implementation patterns, and technical architecture for making the AI Coach truly interactive.

## Core Principle
**Every AI response should be actionable when appropriate.** The AI doesn't just provide advice - it executes changes, creates plans, and modifies data based on user intent.

## Functional Action Categories

### 1. Workout Schedule Management

#### 1.1 Viewing Workouts
**User Requests:**
- "What's on my workout today?"
- "Show me this week's schedule"
- "What exercises am I doing tomorrow?"

**AI Actions:**
- Query actual workout database for today's/requested day's workout
- Display exercises with sets, reps, duration
- Show workout status (completed, pending, skipped)

**Implementation:**
```typescript
// Action: GET_TODAYS_WORKOUT
async function getTodaysWorkout() {
  const today = new Date();
  const workout = await workoutScheduleService.getWorkoutForDate(today);
  return {
    action: 'DISPLAY_WORKOUT',
    data: workout,
    message: `Here's your workout for today (${formatDate(today)}):`
  };
}
```

#### 1.2 Modifying Workout Schedule
**User Requests:**
- "I want a rest day today"
- "Move today's workout to tomorrow"
- "Cancel Thursday's workout"
- "Swap Monday and Wednesday workouts"

**AI Actions:**

**Implementation:**
```typescript
// Action: REQUEST_REST_DAY
async function requestRestDay(date: Date) {
  const currentWorkout = await workoutScheduleService.getWorkoutForDate(date);
  return {
    action: 'CONFIRM_CHANGE',
    data: {
      change: 'rest_day',
      original: currentWorkout,
      proposed: { type: 'rest', activities: ['light stretching', 'walk'] }

  intent: string;
  entities: Record<string, any>;
  confidence: number;
  requiresConfirmation: boolean;
  data?: any;
}

class ActionRecognizer {
  async analyzeMessage(message: string): Promise<AIAction[]> {
    const intents = await this.extractIntents(message);
    const entities = await this.extractEntities(message);
    
    return intents.map(intent => ({
      type: this.mapIntentToAction(intent),
      intent,
      entities,
      confidence: intent.confidence,
      requiresConfirmation: this.needsConfirmation(intent),
    }));
  }
}
```

### 2. Confirmation System
```typescript
interface ConfirmationPrompt {
  message: string;
  options: ConfirmationOption[];
  data: any;
  timeout?: number;
}

interface ConfirmationOption {
  text: string;
  action: () => Promise<ActionResult>;
  style: 'primary' | 'secondary' | 'destructive';
}

class ConfirmationManager {
  async requestConfirmation(prompt: ConfirmationPrompt): Promise<ActionResult> {
    // Display confirmation UI
    // Wait for user response
    // Execute confirmed action
  }
}
```

### 3. Workout Data Services
```typescript
class WorkoutScheduleService {
  async getWorkoutForDate(date: Date): Promise<Workout>;
  async updateWorkout(date: Date, workout: Workout): Promise<void>;
  async moveWorkout(fromDate: Date, toDate: Date): Promise<void>;
  async deleteWorkout(date: Date): Promise<void>;
  async createWorkout(date: Date, workout: Workout): Promise<void>;
}

class ExerciseService {
  async findAlternatives(exercise: string, criteria: string[]): Promise<Exercise[]>;
  async getExerciseDetails(exerciseId: string): Promise<Exercise>;
  async filterByEquipment(exercises: Exercise[], equipment: string[]): Promise<Exercise[]>;
}
```

### 4. AI Response Enhancement
```typescript
interface EnhancedAIResponse {
  message: string;
  actions?: AIAction[];
  confirmations?: ConfirmationPrompt[];
  data?: any;
  ui?: UIComponent[];
}

class AIResponseProcessor {
  async enhanceResponse(
    aiResponse: string, 
    userMessage: string
  ): Promise<EnhancedAIResponse> {
    const actions = await this.extractActions(aiResponse, userMessage);
    const confirmations = await this.createConfirmations(actions);
    const ui = await this.generateUIComponents(actions);
    
    return {
      message: aiResponse,
      actions,
      confirmations,
      ui
    };
  }
}
```
