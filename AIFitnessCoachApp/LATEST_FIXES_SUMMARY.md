# AI Fitness Coach - Latest Fixes Summary

## 1. AI Coach Schedule Context Enhancement
**Issue**: AI was giving generic timeout responses instead of actual schedule information
**Fix Applied**: 
- Added detailed logging to debug what context is being sent to the AI
- The workout context is now properly included with each message
- Added console log to see exact data being sent

**What to check**:
```
LOG  Sending context to AI: {
  "date": "2025-06-04T...",
  "day_of_week": "Wednesday",
  "scheduled_workouts": { ... },
  "message_contains_schedule_query": true
}
```

If `scheduled_workouts` is null or empty, the schedule service may not have data for today.

## 2. Enhanced Fasting Screen - Complete Feature Set
**Issue**: Fasting screen was basic with no history or stats
**Fixes Applied**:
- Added fasting history tracking (last 5 sessions displayed)
- Added current streak calculation
- Added stats section showing:
  - Current day streak
  - Total completed fasts
  - Longest fast duration
- All data persists using AsyncStorage
- History automatically updates after each fast

**New Features**:
- Visual stats cards with icons
- Recent fasts history with completion status
- Automatic streak calculation
- Success indicators for completed fasts

## 3. Modal Rendering Issues Fixed
**Issue**: Edit Profile and Goals modals not showing due to BlurView issues
**Fix Applied**:
- Removed BlurView wrapper from both modals
- Added solid background color (#1a1a2e) to modal containers
- Simplified modal structure for better rendering

**Affected Modals**:
- ✅ Edit Profile Modal
- ✅ Fitness Goals Modal

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Test AI Coach Schedule Awareness:
- Open Messages tab
- Ask "What's on my schedule today?"
- Check console logs for the context being sent
- Verify if scheduled_workouts contains data

### 2. Test Enhanced Fasting Screen:
- Go to Fasting tab
- Start a fast and immediately end it to create history
- Check if stats update (streak, completed count)
- Verify history shows the session
- Start another fast to see timer working

### 3. Test Modal Fixes:
- Go to Profile tab
- Click "Edit Profile" - modal should appear
- Click "Fitness Goals" - modal should appear
- Both should have dark backgrounds and be fully visible

## Debugging Tips

If AI still gives generic responses:
1. Check console for "Sending context to AI" log
2. Verify `scheduled_workouts` has data
3. If empty, the workout schedule service may need initialization

If modals still don't appear:
1. Check console for "Edit Profile clicked" log
2. Try removing `transparent` prop from Modal component temporarily
3. Check if modal styles have proper z-index
