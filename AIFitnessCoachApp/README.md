## üöÄ Quick Start (Development)

1. **Install Dependencies**
```bash
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

2. **Run on Android Emulator**
```bash
npx react-native run-android
```

3. **Run on iOS Simulator** (macOS only)
```bash
cd ios && pod install && cd ..
npx react-native run-ios
```

## üì± Running on Physical Devices

### Android Device
```bash
# Enable Developer Mode and USB Debugging on your Android device
# Connect device via USB

# Verify device is connected
adb devices

# Run the app
npx react-native run-android
```

### iOS Device (macOS only)
```bash
# Connect iPhone via USB and trust the computer

# In Xcode:
# 1. Select your connected device from the device list
# 2. Click the Run button or press Cmd+R
```

## üîß Backend Setup (Optional - for AI features)

1. **Navigate to backend directory**
```bash
cd backend
```

2. **Create virtual environment**
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. **Install dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. **Set up environment variables**
Create `backend/.env`:
```env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost/aicoach
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
JWT_SECRET=your-jwt-secret
```

5. **Run the backend**
```bash
python main.py
```

Backend will run on http://localhost:8000

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Android Build Issues

**Java Version Error:**
```bash
# Use Java 17 for React Native
export JAVA_HOME=$(/usr/libexec/java_home -v 17)
```

**Gradle Build Failed:**
```bash
cd android
./gradlew clean
cd ..
npx react-native run-android
```

### iOS Build Issues

**Pod Installation Failed:**
```bash
cd ios
rm -rf Pods Podfile.lock
pod install --repo-update
cd ..
```

**Build Failed in Xcode:**
1. Clean build folder: Shift+Cmd+K
2. Delete derived data: ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData
3. Restart Xcode

### Metro Bundler Issues

```bash
# Reset cache
npx react-native start --reset-cache

# Kill existing Metro processes
killall -9 node
```

## üîß Backend Configuration (Optional)

The app includes a Python FastAPI backend with advanced multi-agent AI capabilities:

### Starting the Backend

```bash
# Navigate to backend directory
cd backend

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Create .env file with your API keys
echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here" > .env

# Run the backend server
python app.py
```

The backend will start on `http://localhost:8000`

### Multi-Agent System Features

When the backend is running, the app automatically enables:
- **Multi-Agent Responses** - Multiple AI specialists collaborate on your queries
- **Agent Visibility** - See which specialists (nutrition, recovery, etc.) contributed
- **Timeline Integration** - All agents have access to your workout schedule
- **Smart Workout Modifications** - Agents can modify your schedule based on needs

Toggle between single/multi-agent mode using the people/person icon in the AI chat header.

## üîë API Keys

For full functionality, configure these in the backend:
- **OpenAI API Key** - Required for AI coach chat and multi-agent system
- **WGER API** - No key needed (public API for exercises)

## üìù Important Notes

1. **This is the single unified codebase** - Use only this directory for all builds
2. **Demo account works offline** - No backend needed for basic testing
3. **Backend required for**: AI coach chat, workout recommendations, data persistence
4. **Build locations**:
   - Android APK: `android/app/build/outputs/apk/`
   - iOS IPA: Exported from Xcode Organizer

## üö® Common Issues & Solutions

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| "Cannot find module" | Run `npm install --legacy-peer-deps` |
| "SDK location not found" | Open project in Android Studio once |
| "No bundle URL present" | Run `npx react-native start` first |
| "Could not connect to development server" | Check Metro is running on port 8081 |

## üìû Support

For additional help:
1. Check the [React Native docs](https://reactnative.dev/docs/getting-started)
2. Review the troubleshooting section above
3. Check Metro bundler logs for errors
