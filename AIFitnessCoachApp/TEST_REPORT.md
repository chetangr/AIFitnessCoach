## 📱 **How to Test the App**

### **Option 1: Physical Device (Recommended)**
```bash
# 1. Install Expo Go on your phone from App Store/Play Store

# 2. Start the development server
cd /Users/chetangrandhe/Desktop/AIFitnessCoach/AIFitnessCoachApp
npx expo start

# 3. Scan the QR code that appears in terminal with:
#    - iOS: Camera app
#    - Android: Expo Go app

# 4. App will load in Expo Go on your device
```

### **Option 2: Web Testing (Requires Additional Setup)**
```bash
# Install web dependencies first
npx expo install react-dom react-native-web @expo/metro-runtime

# Then run
npm run web
```

### **Option 3: iOS Simulator (After Fixing Xcode)**
```bash
# Fix simulator issue first:
sudo xcode-select --reset
# or
sudo xcode-select --switch /Applications/Xcode.app
