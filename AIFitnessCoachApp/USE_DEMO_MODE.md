# Running AI Fitness Coach in Demo Mode

Since you're having network issues, you can use the app in Demo Mode which doesn't require the backend.

## How to Use Demo Mode

1. **Just start Expo normally:**
   ```bash
   cd /Users/chetangrandhe/Desktop/AIFitnessCoach/AIFitnessCoachApp
   npx expo start
   ```

2. **Open on your Android device** (press 'a' or scan QR code)

3. **The app will automatically use demo mode when it can't reach the backend**

## What Works in Demo Mode

✅ **Full UI/UX** - All screens and navigation work
✅ **Exercise Library** - Browse 10,000+ exercises
✅ **Workout Tracking** - Track sets, reps, weights
✅ **Timeline** - View and move workouts
✅ **Stats & Export** - View stats and export data
✅ **AI Coach** - Demo responses (not real AI)
✅ **Login** - Use demo@fitness.com / demo123

## What Doesn't Work

❌ Real AI responses (uses pre-written demo messages)
❌ Data persistence between app restarts
❌ Multi-device sync

## Benefits

- No backend setup required
- Works immediately
- Test all UI features
- No network configuration needed

This is perfect for testing the app functionality while we sort out the network issues!
